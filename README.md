# 7DTDRemoveLightning
Remove lightning flashes during blood moons and rain. This mod uses Harmony, so EAC must be disabled. Only those intending to benefit from the mod need to have it in their mods folder.

If you would like to disable rain, I use BTF2020's modlet NoRain:

The server host will need NoRain in their mods folder to disable rain on the server.
